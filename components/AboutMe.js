      <p className=" text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">I wasnt always a web developer. Previously I worked as Guest Relations Manager of a boutique hotel, however in my free time, I pursued my passion for web development and built a few Shopify stores. I also managed Facebook ad campaigns for these stores.</p>
      <p className=" text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">In December 2022, I quit my job and decided to dive deeper in the world of web development.</p>
      <p className=" text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">In January 2023, I joined the very intensive <span className="text-teal-500">  360-hours Le Wagon Bootcamp</span> in Amsterdam. Right after that, in April, I immediately embarked on another exciting learning journey by enrolling in the App Brewery online bootcamp. This program teaches React, Nodejs, EJS, MongoDB, Blockchain, Motoko and more.</p>
      <p className=" text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">I have had the opportunity of living in Australia, the United States, Brazil, Portugal and now in the Netherlands, and have traveled to all five continents during the time I worked for the Dutch cruise line Holland America Line. Through these experiences, I have developed a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and a global perspective.</p>
      <p className=" text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">With a continuous learning mindset, I embrace challenges and proactively seek opportunities to expand my skill set.</p>
